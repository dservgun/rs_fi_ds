    /// Preferred Stock is a class of stock, not debt instrument, but is shares some of the
    /// characteristics of both a common stock and a bond. Like the holder of a common stock,
    /// The difference though is that *Preferred Stock* dividends are a specified percentage of
    /// par or face value and this percentage is called the *dividend rate*; which could float
    /// over the life of the issue.

    /// Preferred stock could either be *cumulative preferred stock* which allows the issuer to

    /// if an individual owns a preferred stock all the payments received are treated
    /// as a distribution of the earnings and subject to tax. On the other hand, if the

    /// Interest rate payments are considered debt and therefore tax deductible,
    /// whereas payments made to holders of preferred stocks are treated as distribution
    /// of earnings and therefore not tax deductible.
    /// This part of the tax code has two implications:
    ///   . Major buyers of preferred stocks are corporations seeking tax-advantage investments.
    ///   . The cost of preferred stock issuance is lower that it would be in the absence of the tax
    ///     provision because the tax benefits are passed to the issuer by the willingness of the buyer
    ///     to accept a lower dividend rate.
